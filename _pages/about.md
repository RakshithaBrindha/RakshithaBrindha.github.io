Hi! I am Rakshitha, a 25 year old recent Master graduate from Tamil Nadu which is a semi-coastal state in Southern India. I graduated with my Bachelorâ€™s in Information Technology in India, and moved to Germany for nearly 4 years now. 

I have always been in awe in the advancements of Information Technology. Seeing that a simple google search can retrieve a piece of information or an AI can solve chess games, make musical notes and even write and solve riddles, or a simple chart can help a company grow and the various other functionalities in computer science instilled a desire in me to be part of this futuristic field. This motivated me to pursue my masters in the field of Computer Science. I have completed [Google Analytical Course](https://coursera.org/share/ec70c985e882ae7cce91f2932a798c16)

In my free time I would like to hike, backpack and dive. Something interesting: I have a pet tortoise, I am a certified scuba diver, I have climbed Germany's highest Peak.
